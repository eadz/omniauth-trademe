How To Use It
-------------

If you are using rails, you need to add the gem to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'omniauth-trademe'

You can pull them in directly from github e.g.:

    gem "omniauth-trademe", :git => "git://github.com/eadz/omniauth-trademe.git"

Once these are in, you need to add the following to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
    	provider :trademe, 'consumer_key', 'consumer_secret'
    end

User the name of the class as provider(trademe), however to authorize, you should use the provider name which is 'trademe'.


You will obviously have to put in your key and secret, which you can get from my trademe -> my applications


After you have the gem running and the configuration is done, you can get to the follow url to log the user in:

	http://localhost:3000/auth/trademe

Now just follow the README at: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth
